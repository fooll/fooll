# Support us!
This project is new! and we believe it will succeed. However coding requires time and effort.

We need some help to continue development, we’re planning to add many new features to the framework, write good docs and tutorial, making video tutorials…

So it would be amazing if you participate with at least **1$** to encourage us to develop a better framework **_for you_**.

If you can't help us with donations, star the project in github to show us you like the project.
